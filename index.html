            <h2><i class="fas fa-user-astronaut section-icon"></i> About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Z</strong>. I'm currently pursuing my degree in <strong>Design and Technology</strong> at <strong>Parsons School of Design</strong>, where I explore the intersection of art, design, and emerging technologies. My work often aims to bridge the gap between playful creativity and critical engagement with the digital world.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond my coursework, I'm passionate about immersive and interactive media, and I enjoy crafting unique experiences that blend aesthetic storytelling with cutting-edge tech.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap section-icon"></i> Academic Background</h2>
            <p>As a current student in the Design and Technology program at Parsons, I immerse myself in both theoretical frameworks and hands-on practice. The curriculum encourages us to push creative boundaries, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and reimagine the role of technology in contemporary life. This environment has equipped me with a strong foundation in design thinking, user experience, and interaction design.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-tools section-icon"></i> Skills & Expertise</h2>
            <p>I love experimenting with various tools and platforms to create interactive installations, generative art pieces, and dynamic visual experiences. Here are a few areas I‚Äôm particularly drawn to:</p>
            <ul class="icon-list">
                <li><i class="fas fa-robot list-icon"></i> <strong>Generative AI</strong>: Crafting interactive and evolving artworks using cutting-edge AI models.</li>

                <li><i class="fas fa-code-branch list-icon"></i> <strong>ComfyUI</strong>: Developing modular and customizable AI-driven workflows to refine generative outputs.</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-microchip list-icon"></i> <strong>Arduino</strong>: Creating tangible interfaces and sensor-based systems that integrate physical computing with digital expression.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to these specialized tools, I‚Äôm proficient in creative coding platforms like p5.js, and have a growing interest in extending these explorations into VR/AR experiences and data-driven visualizations.</p>

        <section class="philosophy card">
            <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb section-icon"></i> Creative Philosophy</h2>
            <p>My creative philosophy centers around the idea that technology should enable us to tell more impactful stories, not just simplify or automate. By blending logic with emotion, form with function, and code with creativity, I strive to design experiences that both captivate and provoke thought. In my journey, I seek collaborations that challenge my perspective, as well as opportunities to learn from different disciplines, communities, and cultures.</p>
